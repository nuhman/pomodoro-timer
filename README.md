# pomodoro-timer
a pomodoro timer for enhancing productivity - Customizable to meet your productivity goals.  
  
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.  
**Goal** of the technique is to reduce the impact of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow. A pomodoro is indivisible. When interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed or the pomodoro must be abandoned. [tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
